World War II (WWII or WW2) was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations. It was fought between the Allies, which included countries such as the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and the Axis powers, including Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Fascist Italy. WWII was the deadliest conflict in human history, with an estimated 70 to 85 million casualties.

The war began with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939. This led to the United Kingdom and France declaring war on Germany. Over the following years, the war expanded into multiple theaters, including Europe, the Pacific, and North Africa. The war saw the use of new technologies such as tanks, fighter aircraft, and eventually nuclear bombs.

The war ended in 1945, with the unconditional surrender of Germany in May and Japan in September. The aftermath of WWII reshaped international relations, leading to the establishment of the United Nations and the beginning of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
